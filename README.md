# Node.js File Manager Project

## Overview:

The Node.js File Manager Project is a learning endeavor focused on building a file management application using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3. The project allows users to create folders, upload files to AWS S3, and perform basic file management operations. 

## Key Features:

- User registration and authentication using JWT tokens.
- Folder creation and subfolder management.
- Secure file uploads to AWS S3 with metadata stored in PostgreSQL.
- Basic file operations (renaming, moving, deleting).

## Project Structure:

The codebase follows best practices, with organized modules for controllers, models, routes, utils, and config.

## How to Run:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure AWS credentials in `config/awsConfig.js`.
3. Run the application: `node index.js`

## Submission:

The project, including the database schema, is available on GitHub: [Your GitHub Repository Link].

### Note to Reviewer:

This project is part of my learning journey with AWS, and as such, certain features may not be fully completed. I appreciate your understanding and welcome any feedback for improvement.

### Future Plans:

I plan to continue refining and expanding this project as I deepen my understanding of AWS services and best practices.
